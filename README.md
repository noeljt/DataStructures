# DataStructures
Homework and Labs from class on data structures, taught in C++.

Taught by Professor Barb Cutler, Spring 2015

This is my second computer science course, taken following Computer Science 1.

This class aims to educate about various common data structures found in computer science,
in addition to their advantages and disadvantages.
This is done using both STL classes and creating our own versions of common structures such as:
vectors, lists, maps, priority queue, etc.
